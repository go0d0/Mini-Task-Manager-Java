# Mini Task Manager

This repository contains a simple, command-line-based Java program called `MiniTaskManager.java`. This program serves as a demonstration of various core Java concepts. The user can choose from a menu of options to see different features in action.

**Note:** The source code and the command-line prompts are in Indonesian.

## Features

The `MiniTaskManager.java` program demonstrates the following Java concepts:

1.  **Override**: Demonstrates the use of the `@Override` annotation, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass or an interface.
2.  **Overloading**: Shows how multiple methods can have the same name but with different parameters.
3.  **ArrayList**: A simple demonstration of how to create and read from an `ArrayList`. The example simulates a restaurant ordering system.
4.  **HashMap**: A demonstration of how to create and read from a `HashMap`. The example simulates a student information system.
5.  **Lambda**: Shows how to use a lambda expression to provide an implementation for a functional interface.
6.  **Stream API**: Demonstrates the use of the Stream API for processing collections of objects. The user can choose to see either the `filter` or `map` operation.
7.  **Manual Threading**: A demonstration of how to create and run threads manually by implementing the `Runnable` interface.
8.  **Executor Service**: Shows how to use an `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads.
9.  **Executor Service with Synchronization**: A demonstration of how to use an `ExecutorService` with synchronized methods to prevent race conditions.

## Getting Started

To compile and run this program, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

### Compiling the Code

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `MiniTaskManager.java` file.
3.  Run the following command to compile the code:

    ```bash
    javac MiniTaskManager.java
    ```

    This will create a new file called `MiniTaskManager.class`, which contains the compiled Java bytecode.

### Running the Program

Once you have compiled the code, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
java MiniTaskManager
```

You will be presented with a menu of options in Indonesian. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing `Enter`.
