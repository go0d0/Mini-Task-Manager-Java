# My Java Journey

Welcome to your Java learning adventure! This repository contains a single Java file, `MyJavaJourney.java`, designed to help you get started with the basics of the Java programming language.

## About the Code

The `MyJavaJourney.java` file is a simple program that demonstrates several fundamental concepts in Java, including:

*   **Classes and Methods**: The basic building blocks of a Java program.
*   **The `main` Method**: The entry point for any Java application.
*   **Comments**: How to document your code.
*   **Variables and Data Types**: Storing and using different kinds of data, such as numbers, text, and boolean values.
*   **Console Output**: Printing information to the console.
*   **Methods and Parameters**: Creating reusable blocks of code.

## Getting Started

To compile and run this program, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

### Compiling the Code

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `MyJavaJourney.java` file.
3.  Run the following command to compile the code:

    ```bash
    javac MyJavaJourney.java
    ```

    This will create a new file called `MyJavaJourney.class`, which contains the compiled Java bytecode.

### Running the Program

Once you have compiled the code, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
java MyJavaJourney
```

You should see the following output in your console:

```
